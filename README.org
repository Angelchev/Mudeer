** Installation

*** KDE Store (Through Systemsettings)
Under SystemSettings -> Kwin Scripts, you can search for and install Mudeer.
   
*** Manual
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    git clone https://github.com/darkstego/Mudeer.git
    kpackagetool5 -i Mudeer || kpackagetool5 -u Mudeer
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Configuration
   Configuration is done through KDE's Kwin Script Configuration. Find Mudeer under System Settings -> Kwin Scripts and there will be an options button.

   When changing the options you need to disable then enable the script for the changes to take effect. I think this is a quirk in KDE scripts.

** Shortcuts
   The default shortcuts were designed to easily use with the left
   hand to allow use quickly while using the mouse. As a result, *some of these shortcuts will not be enabled unless they are enabled manually* through the KDE shortcut menu. This happens when some of
   those shortcuts overwrite others in KDE.

   You can see all the shortcuts for this project by searching the
   global shortcuts settings menu for "mudeer".

   The Shortcuts all use the Meta (known as Win or Super outside
   KDE). Below is the explenation of the default bindings.
*** Thirds
    Use Meta + A,S,D for left middle and right thirds respectively.
    
    Alt modifier for only the bottom half.
    
    Ctrl modifier for only the top half.

    Shift modifier increases width to encompass all neighboring
    thirds. (e.g. Pressing Meta+Shift+A will make the window take up
    the left and middle thirds). Note: if chosen with middle third
    (S) then it will consider it as middle-half, since otherwise it
    would be identical to maximize.
    
    Note: Middle third can be made bigger than the others by using the Kwin Configuration.
    This is useful to give extra space to the middle window in a three wide display.

*** Quarters    
    Use Meta + Z,X,C,V for left, middle left, middle right, and right Quarters respectively.
    
    Alt modifier for only the bottom half.
    
    Ctrl modifier for only the top half.

    Shift modifier increases width to encompass all neighboring
    slots. (e.g. Pressing Meta+Shift+X will make the window take up
    the left 3/4 of the screen).

*** Fullscreen
Pressing the Fullscreen Prefix keys prior to any other shortcuts will fullscreen the window to the selected section of the screen. The fullscreen behavior ignores panels and gaps when calculating the portion of the screen to occupy. This allows fullscreen applications like games or video to occupy a portion of the screen in a manner similar to hardware picture by picture modes.

The second prefix (avoiding panels) calculates the section of the screen in the same manner as regular fullscreen but does not overlap any panels in that section. This will act as a maximize if the monitor consisted of only that portion of teh screen. This is useful if you are running a fullscreen application on a portion of the screen and wanted to to maximize a window on the remaining portion of the screen.  

One recommendation is binding "Maximize Window" and "Fullscreen" from KDE KWin shortcuts to Meta+f and Meta+Shift+f as it fits logically with these shortcuts. I also bind "Minimize Window" to Meta+Alt+f to maximize the utilization of the shortcut keys available.
    
*** Summary Table 
Below is the list of default shortcuts. Again, Meta in KDE is the Win (or Super) key.

| Shortcut                          | Default Binding   |
|-----------------------------------+-------------------|
| Whole                             | Meta+f            |

| Center Third                      | Meta+s            |

| Far Right Quarter                 | Meta+v            |
| Left Half                         | Meta+Shift+z      |
| Left Three Quarters               | Meta+Shift+x      |
| Center Half                       | Meta+Shift+s      |
| Right Three Quarters              | Meta+Shift+c      |
| Right Half                        | Meta+Shift+v      |
| Top half modifier                 | Ctrl+             |
| Bottom half modifier              | Alt+              |
|-----------------------------------+-------------------|
| Gapless Prefix                    | Meta+Shift+f      |
| Fullscreen Prefix                 | Meta+Ctrl+Shift+f |
| Fullscreen Prefix avoiding Panels | Meta+Alt+Shift+f  |

*** Shortcuts Visualizations
Must press the Meta (aka Win or Super) key with all these shortcuts.
    
**** Standard Shortcuts
     #+ATTR_HTML: :style margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
     [[https://github.com/darkstego/Mudeer/blob/media/Mudeer-shortcuts.png]]     
 
*** Vertical (Portrait) Monitors
When the monitor is in the Vertical orientation then the segementation (quarters and thirds) occur top to bottom instead of left to right maximizing the resolution of the splts along the long edge of the screen. In this orientation the CTRL and ALT modifier keys restricts the windows to the left and right portion of the screen respectively.


*** Recommendations for Non-Ultrawide Monitors
    For users of Non Ultrawide Monitors this script can be utilized by only mapping shortcuts for the left and right half tiling (and their top/bottom alternatives). This is functionally similar to KDE's own Quick Tile option with the added flexibility of having an adjustable gap between the windows.
      
** Troubleshooting

*** No configuration menus
  Users on Plasma versions <5.23 check the [[https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444378#c10][following fix]] to get configuration menus to work.

*** Configuration option changes not having any affect
Disable and then re-enable the script to get it the settings to register.

*** Some of the shortcuts don't work
There might be a collision with existing KDE shortcuts. Try to search
for the buttons in the shorcut menu in systemsettings to find the collision.
