   You will need to log out and back into the plasma session for changes to take effect.

** Configuration
   Configuration is done through KDE's Kwin Script Configuration.
   You are able to configure the width of middle window in a 3-wide configuration.

** Shortcuts
   The default shortcuts were designed to easily use with the left hand to allow use quickly while using the mouse. As a result, *some of these shortcuts will not be enabled unless they are enabled manually* through the KDE shortcut menu. This happens when some of those shortcuts overwrite others in KDE.

You can see all the shortcuts for this project by searching the global shortcuts settings menu for "mudeer".

Below is the list of default shortcuts.
